1. Download the module, unzip the source, and put the resulting directory into the 
   modules/ directory of your Drupal application.

   administrator approval at Administer > User Management > User Settings

installed for you.

In order to enable Facebook, MySpace, and Windows Live accounts, you must register with the
respective services.  Links from the control panel are provided, with step-by-step setup

Troubleshooting
===============

Problem: Users get an error during registration that says "The configured token URL has not been whitelisted"
Solution: Try editing the settings in your RPX account to use a wildcard for subdomains. So your domains would
  include mysite.com and also *.mysite.com. http://rpxnow.com/account
